    "We have successfully implemented a comprehensive data splitting solution that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breaks down long segments** into subsegments using `sampled_consecutive_days` (1-7 days)\n",
    "2. **Maintains 6:2:2 ratio** across train/validation/test splits\n",
    "3. **Ensures representation** from all months in each split\n",
    "4. **Splits both aggregate data and load signatures** consistently\n",
    "5. **Saves everything** in a dedicated `split/` folder with clear structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Temporal consistency**: Load signatures are split based on the same time segments as aggregate data\n",
    "- **No data leakage**: Train/val/test splits are completely separate\n",
    "- **Balanced representation**: Each split contains segments of various lengths (1-7 days)\n",
    "- **Month diversity**: All splits contain data from all available months\n",
    "- **Easy loading**: Helper functions for convenient data access\n",
